Description of different parameters of the alg and the results.

Baseline solution4 (p = 0.2, heuristic = degree(v) - weight(e))
Avg cost: 67.99464823721601

Enhanced Baseline: Baseline solution4 + finding a smaller dominating set (multiple iterations of networkx function)
Avg cost:

p = 0.2, heuristic = 2 * degree(v) - weight(e)
Avg cost:
